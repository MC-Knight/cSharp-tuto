Console.WriteLine("Hello World");


string name = "Joseph";

//output with WriteLine which outputs with new line like theone \n in other many languages
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!");
Console.WriteLine("Hello" +name);

//output with Write only which write without breaking a line
Console.Write("Hello there");
Console.Write("How are you doing");

//it comes [like Hello there How are you doing] instead of two lines
